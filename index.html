<h1>PINEAPPLE FRIED RICE RECIPE</h1>    
<p>
    Pineapple fried rice, known in Thailand as <em>khao phat sapparot</em>, is a popular Southeast Asian dish characterized by a sweet-and-savory flavor profile, combining jasmine rice, fresh pineapple chunks, cashews, and a savory sauce. 
    Often served in a hollowed-out pineapple bowl, this dish typically features curry powder, fish sauce, and a mix of vegetables and proteins like shrimp or chicken.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>Rice</li>
<li>Pineapple</li>
<li>Protein</li>
<li>Flavorings</li>
<li>Mix-ins/Garnish</li>
</ul>

<h2>Intsructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Cook jasmine rice ahead of time and cool it completely. If using a whole pineapple, cut it in half, score the inside, and scoop out the fruit to make a bowl.</li>
<li>Sear shrimp or chicken in a wok with high heat, remove, and set aside. Scramble eggs and remove.</li>
<li> Sauté garlic, ginger, onion, and any veggies (peas, carrots, bell peppers).</li>
<li>Add the rice and the sauce (fish sauce, soy sauce, curry powder) to the wok. Stir-fry on high heat until the rice is coated and slightly caramelized.</li>
<li>Mix in the pineapple, cooked proteins, eggs, and cashews, tossing until heated through.</li>
<li>Garnish with green onions and serve immediately, ideally in the pineapple bowl. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips For Success</h2>
<p>Avoid Mushy Rice: Use cold, leftover rice.
Balance the Flavors: Use a just-ripened, not over-ripe, pineapple to ensure it is sweet but not overly mushy, and balance the sweetness with fish sauce.
High Heat: Cook on high heat to prevent the pineapple from releasing too much moisture and making the dish watery.
Vegan Option: Substitute fish sauce with soy sauce or miso paste, and use tofu instead of meat.</p>
